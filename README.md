# GraphQL Demo

GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.

## Usage

Clone the repository locally. Navigate to the directory and run

```
npm install
```

and afterwards

```
npm start
```

## Models

A simple Note model is added for the demo purpose with the following attributes:
 - title
 - description
 - status
 - date

This model can be used by GraphQL to add a new note as well as query the note. We will have a look at this in the specific Mutation (Adding a new Note) and Query (Querying the note data) sections below.

## User Interface

The system should be up and running at this point. Open a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:3200. This page is not useful for now. For GraphQL interface, go to http://localhost:3200/graphql
